    "## Digital Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "In communication systems, our model consists of a sender and receiver communicating over a channel. Broadly speaking, there are two types of communication: analog and digital. Orthogonal Signaling is a method for digital communication. Unliked analog communication, where the data we actually want to send is a continuous-time signal, in digital communication, we want to send bits, which are discrete. For example, we may want to send a text file by first encoding it into its binary ASCII values. In the case of Amplitude Modulation (AM), an analog communication method, we saw that we needed to modulate the signal we wanted to send up to a higher frequency range before actually sending it. Similarly with digital communication, we cannot send raw bits themselves, and ultimately must convert our bits into a continuous-time signal before we can send it. Orthogonal signaling is one technique for achieving this."

    "\n",
    "The sender communicates the bits by splitting up the data into fixed-sized chunks (for example, 3-bit chunks), modulating each, and sending the entire modulated signal. For an individual chunk, the sender will choose the signal $x(t)$ to send. If we use $k$ bit chunks, we'll need $2^k$ different signals to choose from, one per possible bit pattern. In orthogonal signaling, the choice of $x(t)$ is made from a family of orthogonal functions, which have nice properties for decoding and noise analysis as you saw in the homework. An orthogonal signaling scheme relies on two choices: $k$, the number of bits ber chunk, and $T$ (which corresponds to frequency $f_c = 1/T$), the duration of a continuous-time signal in the basis. \n",

(This is, of course, assuming no noise, which never occurs in practice.

    "For example, suppose we're recording someone singing, and someone yells from a nearby room and messes up part of the recording. This kind of noise is called \"shot noise\", because of its short duration and high intensity, like a gunshot. Thermal noise from nearby devices giving off heat is another type, as electric circuits have temperature-dependent behavior. Yet another is ADC jitter: in EE 120 we consider the model of uniform sampling, where we obtain a discrete-time signal from a continuous-time one by taking samples of it that are uniformly spaced in time. In practice, there is no such thing as uniform sampling - ADCs (Analog to Digital Converters), the devices that actually perform sampling, have some error margin in where they actually sample, known as \"ADC jitter\". Fortunately, hardware engineers have shrunk this error margin down to several orders of magnitude less than the actual sampling frequency in modern ADCs to the point where it's negligible from our point of view. You can check out some actual specs for a real ADC and its jitter (sometimes also referred to as \"aperture uncertainty\") in the first reference. \n",

    "## Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most ubiquitous model for noise in all of engineering is Additive White Gaussian Noise, or AWGN. There's three elements to dissect about this type of noise:\n",
    "1. **ADDITIVE**: Additive noise is simply noise that is modeled as corruption caused by adding something to our true signal. For example, if the signal sent is $x(t)$, and the noise is $n(t)$, then we receive $y(t) = x(t) + n(t)$. It may seem like all noise should just be modeled as additive - in many cases it is, but there are cases where addition is not the best model for how noise is introduced. For example, if you were modeling the noise from a signal bouncing off of walls, you'd likely model it as a multiplicative attenuation factor rather than the addition of some noise signal.\n",
    "2. **WHITE**: White noise is a signal with a uniform *power spectral density*. The power spectral density of a signal is the Fourier Transform of its autocorrelation. So, when we say that white noise has a uniform power spectral density, what we mean is that if you took a white noise signal, computed its autocorrelation, and took the Fourier Transform of that, it would be a constant. The name comes from the fact that white light was originally (incorrectly) believed to have uniform intensity over the visible band of frequencies. The useful takeaway from this property is that the noise doesn't favor any range of frequencies over another - they're all corrupted the same amount, on average.\n",
    "3. **GAUSSIAN**: It turns out that when you sum up a large number of different random quantities, they approach what's known as a Gaussian distribution (meaning that the actual value itself is random, but the probability it lies within some range is given by a distribution function, which here is the Gaussian, aka the bell curve you've likely seen before). This is known as the *Central Limit Theorem* (you're not responsible for knowing this). Since any given system has a large number of random noise sources contributing to the *overall* noise, which is ultimately what we care about from a modeling perspective, this model is a good one that's very common in signal processing and other related fields. The Gaussian is parameterized by two quantities: $\\mu$, the average value of the noise, and $\\sigma$, the standard deviation of the noise. In almost all cases, $\\mu$ is taken to be zero (known as \"zero-mean noise\") - if it wasn't zero, there would be some systematic bias which could simply be removed post-processing by subtracting this mean. $\\sigma$ controls how strong the noise is - a higher value of $\\sigma$ means the noise is more powerful, on average. Think of $\\sigma$ as a knob that you turn, and as you turn it, the noise gets stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of this noise model has a lot to do with the Central Limit Theorem mentioned above, and it's what we'll use here. Fortunately, it's very easy to implement for simulations: numpy has a built in function for drawing samples from this distribution, `np.random.normal`, which takes in $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ as its first and second parameters. Run the code below to see what the noise looks like for a few different values of $\\sigma$; you don't need to write any code for this cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're not responsible for any probability theory content in this class, so don't worry if you didn't fully understand the above explanation. We just want to expose you to the AWGN model and give you a chance to explore it here due to how ubiquitous it is in signal processing and many other areas of science and engineering as well."

In fact, probability theory tells us that for the Gaussian distribution, roughly 68% of our noise will have an amplitude within $\\pm \\sigma$ of our mean of zero, around 95% within $\\pm 2\\sigma$, and around 99.7% within $\\pm 3\\sigma$. Look at some of the values on your plots and see if this matches them!\n",
    "- Additive noise can be negative, as you see here. You may be confused by this - can't noise only be added on top of our signal, not take away from it? Well, sort of - if you're thinking about literal extra sound that's picked up by, say, a receiver listening for a signal, than perhaps (keep in mind we use noise as a more general term in signal processing - it's not just auditory \"noise\", but anything that corrupts our signal). But remember, we're considering this noise as the contribution of many different sources, such as the fact that the signal will lose some energy as it travels through some wire with resistance or otherwise travel across some distance to the receiver, in which case the signal's actual amplitude will go down from attenuation, hence \"negative\" noise."

    "## Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an idea of what noise is, in particular AWGN, we can study one of the most commonly cited metrics for signal fidelity: Signal-to-Noise Ratio, or SNR for short (sometimes also abbreviated as S/N). SNR allows us to quantify how reliable a particular signal's information is.  A higher SNR is always better, as the higher the SNR, the more powerful your signal is relative to the noise corrupting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition suggests that since an SNR of 1 is where the \"amount\" of signal is equal to the \"amount\" of noise, any SNR above 1 should be good. In most applications, however, the noise will cause noticeable degradation to the signal fidelity for any SNR below around 1000 (this is a coarse estimate, not some exact end-all threshold). An SNR of zero means we have no signal, only noise; an SNR of infinity means we have no noise (or at least noise so weak it can't be measured).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take any signal processing classes beyond EE 120, or work on any signal processing projects, you're guaranteed to see this concept come up - you have to deal with noise in all real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, SNR has a very intuitively satisfying defintion: it is the ratio of signal energy to noise energy:\n",

    "$$SNR = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|\\text{Signal}[n]|^2}{\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|\\text{Noise}[n]|^2}$$\n",

    "where the above formula assumes finite duration signals of length $N$ (in general, the energy is computed with a sum over all integers, but on a computer, things always have finite length).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, SNR measures how many times stronger the true signal is than the noise, in terms of energy. Remember the interpretation of signal energy as the \"L2 norm of a signal\" from Lab 3? Based on that, SNR can be thought of as (the square of) \"how many times longer\" your signal is in $N$-dimensional Euclidean space than the noise is!\n",
    "\n",
    "There's two important things to note about this definition:\n",

Fortunately, in real life, we often have meta-information about the system we're using that we can use to get a good estimate of the SNR. For example, in audio engineering, sinusoids at certain frequencies are the relevant signals, which are often used as the \"signal\" part of the calculation, and the noise of a system is typically a property of phyiscal hardware that can be measured and/or will be supplied by the hardware vendor.\n",

This is due to the fact that a .wav file is an uncompressed audio file format that uses 16 bits to represent each value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, one would never transmit uncompressed data. There are many different ways to reduce the amount of data to send, including (but not limited to):\n",
    "- Lossless compression, such as Huffman (used in MP3) or Arithmetic Codes.\n",
    "- Lossy Compression, such as Quantization and Thresholding (used by JPEG and many image compression algorithms)\n",
    "- Transmitting some transform of the data, where the specific transform chosen is based on the desire for the signal to be sparse in the representation that transform uses:\n",
    "    - Fourier Transform (great for combinations of pure tones, similar to what we have here)\n",
    "    - Discrete Cosine Transform (used in images)\n",
    "    - Wavelet Transform (many variants; most popular is the Haar wavelet basis, which is used for signals that are roughly piecewise-constant as the basis consists of shifted box functions)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Often, these methods are combined, and a lot of file formats you are familiar with (mp3, jpeg) are doing exactly that. If you are interested in learning more about compression, you can read [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression), and can take further classes such as EE 123 (digital signal processing), EE 229A (information theory), or EE 225B (image processing) to learn more.\n",

    "Another thing that could be improved about our scheme is how noise resilient it is. As discussed in the previous section, we modulate the raw data. This does create potential issues with the size of the data, but also with how robust our communication method is. Orthogonal signaling will do its best, but after demodulating, it'd be best if we had another layer of defense, so to speak, that could safeguard against potential errors in the bits themselves. This is where *error-correcting codes* come into play. We won't discuss them here, but in practice, many different codes such as Reed-Solomon codes, Hamming codes, convolutional codes, and more are examples of extra noise resiliency mechanisms that can be added onto the front and end of our communication system to help correct errors by reducing additional redundancy bits.

    "# Concluding Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw here, Orthogonal Signaling is very resilient to noise due to the orthogonality of the different signals/messages sent, because they're very \"far apart\" - the noise has to work very hard to \"push them together\", and as long as we pick a large enough value of `T` for the SNR we're dealing with, we'll be able to win this metaphorical game of tug-of-war.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, Orthogonal Signaling is seldom used due to bandwidth constraints: to send messages as fast as possible but with a low BER, we need a high `T` and high `k`. As we saw in question 1, the number of different signals (and thus the number of different frequencies we send at) grows exponentially with `k`. In practice, we only have a limited bandwidth that we can actually transmit over, due to both FCC allocation constraints as well as actual limits on our hardware. To borrow the example given in the EE 121 notes, if we used an Orthogonal Signaling scheme with $T = 1$ second and wanted to send 30 bits per second (so $k = 30$), then we would need $2^{30}$ different frequencies, which is a bandwidth of just over 1 GHz, which is something we'll never have in practice. Check out the fifth reference if you're interested in seeing how the actual US radio frequencies are allocated by the FCC.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, analyzing and understanding why its orthogonality property makes it so robust aids the design of more practical schemes. The tradeoff off having this strong property of orthogonality is that we have to use up a huge amount of bandwidth - to solve that problem, you can probably guess that we just need something that's similar to orthogonality, but isn't as strong - linear independence! Check out the fourth reference if you're interested in reading more."
